Getting Started
---------------

To get started with RemixPA, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/initializing.html).

To initialize your local repository using the RemixPA trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/yun3195/andriod.git -b remixpa-jb4.3

Then to sync up:

    repo sync
