ParanoidAndroid
===============

Submitting Patches
------------------
We're open source, and patches are always welcome!
You can send patches by using these commands:

    cd <workspace>
    repo start <branch> ParanoidAndroid/<project>
    cd <project>
    git add -A
    git commit -a
    cd <workspace>
    repo upload ParanoidAndroid/<project>

Commit your patches in a single commit. Squash multiple commit using this command: git rebase -i HEAD~<# of commits>

If you are going to make extra additions, just repeat steps (Don't repo start again), but instead of git commit -a
use git commit --amend. Gerrit will recognize it as a new patchset.

To view the status of your and others patches, visit [ParanoidAndroid Code Review](http://gerrit.paranoidandroid.co)
